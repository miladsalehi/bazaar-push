# BazaarPush
BazaarPush is a wrapper based on the popular Laravel Framework which regularly logs into your CafeBazaar accounts, parses pages and pushes reports of new events such as sales on to your devices (via PushBullet).

## Installation

Using [composer](https://packagist.org/packages/nikapps/bazaar-push), add this package dependency to your Laravel's composer.json :

```
{
    "require": {
        "nikapps/bazaar-push": "1.*"
    }
}
```
Update composer :
```
composer update
```
Add this package provider in your providers array `[app/config/app.php]` : 
```
'Nikapps\BazaarPush\BazaarPushServiceProvider'
```
Run migrations for this package, this will add a table to your database named `bazaar_sale` which keeps track of your sale records.
Run :
```
php artisan migrate --package="nikapps/bazaar-push"
```
Publish configuration file.
Run :
```
php artisan config:publish nikapps/bazaar-push
```
Run :
```
php artisan
```
if you see a `bazaarpush` command namespace, you are all set to go !

## Configuration

Open `[app/config/packages/nikapps/bazaar-push/config.php]`.
Setup your CafeBazaar credentials, each one of them as an associative array like the example below : 
```php
"credentials" => [
       [
           "email" => "first@account.com",
           "password" => "secret"
       ],
       [
           "email" => "second@account.com",
           "password" => "top secret"
       ], 
       .
       .
       .
   ]
```
Setup your PushBullet accounts like the example, get your PushBullet API key from [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/account)
```php
"pushbulletKeys" => [
       [
           "key" => "FirstAccountKey",
           "accounts" => ['first@account.com'] // declare CafeBazaar accounts as an array which you want to get reports from them
           "devices" => ['LGENexus 4'] // declare your devices as an array which you want to get pushes on them
       ],
       [
           "key" => "SecondAccountKey",
           "accounts" => null, // you can pass null to get reports from all of your declared CafeBazaar accounts in credentials section
           "devices" => null // you can pass null to get pushes on all of the devices associated with this PushBullet account.
       ],
       .
       .
       .
   ],
```
## Adding Cronjob
This cronjob runs the checking command each 20 minutes and fetches the new sales from CafeBazaar. Also, it will report new events as a push to your devices.
Don't forget to change the artisan path :)
```
*/20 * * * * php /absolute/path/to/your/artisan bazaarpush:sale >/dev/null 2>&1
```
## Probable issues
- This project parses CafeBazaar pages and fetches required data from them, if CafeBazaar changes the current panel layout we need to change the matching Regular Expression patterns. Our recomendation is to set a watcher on this project to keep up with the updates.
- At this moment CafeBazaar just gives the latest 100 sale records, so if you have more than 100 sale records in 20 minutes (#RichKidsOfIran !), you'll lose some of the records.
